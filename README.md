Only free channels

If a channel is normally only available via commercial subscriptions it has nothing to do in this playlist. If on the other hand it is provided for free to everybody in a particular country, then it should be in this playlist.

    No paid channels
    Only channels which are officially provided for free (via DVB-S, DVB-T, analog, etc..)

Only mainstream channels

This is a playlist for everybody.

    No adult channels
    No channels dedicated to any particular religion
    No channels dedicated to any particular political party
    No channels made for a country and funded by a different country
